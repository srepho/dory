    "This tutorial introduces **CrewAI**, a framework designed around the metaphor of AI \"crews\" - teams of agents with defined roles working together on tasks.\n",

    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CrewAI's core concepts: Agents, Tasks, Tools, and Crews\n",
    "2. Building a Weather Verification Agent with tools\n",
    "3. Building a Claims Eligibility Agent for business logic\n",
    "4. Orchestrating agent crews with task dependencies\n",
    "5. Integrating DSPy for prompt optimization\n",
    "6. Using MLFlow for experiment tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.10+\n",
    "- OpenAI API key (or compatible API)\n",
    "- Basic Python knowledge\n",

    "## CrewAI Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "CrewAI takes a **role-based approach** to agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Agent** | An autonomous unit with a role, goal, and backstory |\n",
    "| **Task** | A specific piece of work assigned to an agent |\n",
    "| **Tool** | A capability (function) that agents can use |\n",
    "| **Crew** | A team of agents that collaborate on tasks |\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework is intentionally **verbose** - you define rich persona descriptions for each agent. This can improve outputs but increases token usage."

    "\n",
    "### What We Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CrewAI Concepts**: Agents with roles/goals/backstories, Tasks, Crews\n",
    "2. **Tool Definition**: `@tool` decorator for functions\n",
    "3. **Process Types**: Sequential and hierarchical orchestration\n",
    "4. **DSPy Integration**: Optimize reasoning and enhance backstories\n",
    "5. **MLFlow Tracking**: Log experiments and compare results\n",
    "\n",
    "### CrewAI Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intuitive role-based agent design\n",
    "- Good for complex multi-agent workflows\n",
    "- Task dependencies handled cleanly\n",
    "- Manager/hierarchical patterns built-in\n",
    "\n",
    "### CrewAI Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- Verbose (lots of boilerplate)\n",
    "- Token-heavy (detailed backstories consume tokens)\n",
    "- Less type safety than Pydantic AI\n",
    "- Debugging can be challenging\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Insurance Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Good for**: Teams that think in roles and workflows\n",
    "- **Consider alternatives if**: You need strict type safety or minimal token usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Experiment with hierarchical processes\n",
    "2. Add more training examples to DSPy\n",
    "3. Try different models and compare in MLFlow\n",
    "4. Build more complex crew configurations"
